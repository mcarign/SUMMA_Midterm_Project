# SUMMA_Midterm_Project

This program is from my midterm project at NCSU for Parallel Systems course. The purpose was to implement the SUMMA algorithm on the GeMM operation most commonly used in scientific computing. A PDF reporting my findings, observations, and challenges is within the first folder, P1-mjcarign, and is more descriptive and shows visuals. The files I wrote most of my code or scripts on(~85% - 100% of it) were main.c, Makefile, the other README.mdma, and the batch scripts. Any other C files were mainly helper functions provided by the github the professor told us to clone(https://github.ncsu.edu/jli256/CSC548/tree/main/MidtermProject/denseGEMM-SUMMA) but they did not contribute much to the main lesson of the algorithm.

## Side Note:
I really enjoyed this project and learned a lot about this area in Computer Science, this widened my eyes to the potential and importance of these calculations that seemed so simple. I can see that even as simple and straightforward as they are they can still be improved upon in non intuitive ways that actually cut off a lot of extra time and work in the long run. After this project I really got excited about this area and wanted to do and learn more so that I can eventually break into this area of the Computer Science field.
