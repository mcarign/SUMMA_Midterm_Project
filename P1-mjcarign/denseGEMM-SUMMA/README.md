Midterm Project

To run this program first check in the Makefile to see if the matrix dimension parameters 
you want to pass in to the program are correct. Make sure to use dimensions that are a multiple
of the total number of processors.

Next just submit the summa_gemm.batch batch script and the results of the program will 
appear in the outputs folder. The results to focus on are all the way at the botton of the log.

Each time you want to execute a different matrrix size I suggest changing the name of the 
ouput file by going to the batch script and changing it.
